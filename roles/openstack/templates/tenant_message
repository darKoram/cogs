# Ansible generated tenant_message

An account in the project {{tenant.name}} has been created for you.
                  
 login to {{horizon_dashboard}} 
 user {{item.name}} 
 password {{item.password}}  

 You will need a vpn connection
 to the datacenter for the horizon link or ssh access.
 

 ########## Modify .ssh/config #############

  
 The tenant admin should past the jump_host_ssh_config (see attachment)
 to their ~/.ssh/config file.


########## Modify {{tenant_name}}.yml in deploy_vars directory #########

 The following public ips have been allocated.
 Please add them in
 21ct-ansible/{{deploy_vars_relpath}}/{{tenant_name}}/{{tenant_name}}.yml


 torch_floating_ip: {{torch_floating_ip}} 
 pivot_floating_ip: {{pivot_floating_ip}}


Also replace values in the above file with the following snippet
tenant:
  id: {{tenant_id}}
  network:
    provider_network:
      segmentation_id: {{register_segmentation_id.stdout}}    


# DEPRECATED, the above is auto-filled now, we hope
#by browsing to horizon
#Find the tenant.id by browsing to your project.  Click "Networks" down on the left tab.
#Click on the private_subnet.  tenant.id = Project ID
#The segmenation_id can be gathered by a tenant user by choosing the "Networks" tab 
#and clicking on the private network.

Then change the {{tenant_name}}_tenant_hosts file to uncomment
localhost and comment out node-8 (the controller node)

If you need to customize elasticsearch or torch do so in the {{tenant_name}} folder
in the deploy_vars tree.

When finished, commit and push the changes to stash.



########### /etc/hosts ############

Add the etc_hosts snippet to your /etc/hosts

The following pulbic ips are available.
To avoid conflicts with private ip mappings of lynx01 etc in .ssh/config
we use the full name torch01 etc for public ips.
# Eventually this will be replaced with a single haproxy called torch

{% set torch_name = tenant.name+'-torch' %}
{{torch_floating_ip + ' ' + torch_name + ' ' + torch_name+dns.fqdn_suffix}} 
{% set pivot_name = tenant.name + '-pivot' %}
{{pivot_floating_ip + ' ' + pivot_name + ' ' + pivot_name+dns.fqdn_suffix}} 


######### Next: Create Vms Play #######

Email the tenant admin that they are ready to create the vms starting the step 
following "Create a tenant_hosts file and the openstack tenant" at
http://confluence.21technologies.com/display/21DC/Automated+Provisioning+vms+in+Openstack

ansible-playbook -i {{tenant_name}}_tenant_hosts roles/openstack/playbooks/create_vms_play.yml -e "home_prefix=/home" -K -vvvv
